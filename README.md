# AbundantMicroRNABooleanNetworks
This is a summer project for the purpose of learning Python.

### TODO
1. Make revised .ipynb files

  1.1 micro_rna_main.ipynb

  1.2 abundant_main.ipynb

  1.3 bool_main.ipynb

  1.4 appendix.ipynb

2. Clean up code comments
3. Add clarifying comments
FOR 4: USE VERSION CONTROL
4. Recompose .py and imports as per standard observed during Fall 2024

   4.1 UML class diagram

5. Write unittest s for abundances, and for miRNA knockdown - requires ground truth reference (test that steady state Newton's method approaches exact solutions to differential equations)

6. Proofs file: LaTeX

Preliminary order of steps: 4, 1, 2

### Next steps:
Revise code to employ knowledge of Python syntax and data structures gained during Fall 2024.
